🔧 PROMPT FOR LOVABLE.APP — “Solar AI Agent — Auto Growth System”
(Paste whole block into lovable.app build prompt field)
Project name / Site title:
 Solar AI Agent — Automated B2B Outreach & Growth System for Solar Installers
Short description (1 line):
 A fully automated, zero-investment lead-scraping → multi-channel outreach → AI-calling → CRM-integrated growth engine for solar installation companies.
Long description / Goal (for site generator):
 Build a SaaS-style marketing & sales automation website that sells an AI Calling Agent service to solar installation companies. The site must present the product as an enterprise-grade B2B solution that scrapes public solar company leads (zero upfront investment model), automatically contacts prospects via Email / Instagram DM / Facebook Messenger / LinkedIn Message, and triggers the AI Calling Agent to qualify and book meetings. The site must include: marketing pages, pricing & ROI pages, demo scheduler, admin dashboard, customer dashboard, integrations page, legal & GDPR flow, onboarding wizard, and a full technical architecture page for the client. Use content & sales scripts from the attached file for call scripts and sales copy.
